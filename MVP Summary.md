Understand the key indicators of default
Able to predict default with 

### Data:
- Data set1: Historical data from Kaggle (2007-2015)

- Features contained in data may not have direct relationship with Default. This may lead to addtionalreserach and data collection
- Assumptions made here: default pattern hasn't changed througout of years. This needs to be confirmed.
