# Lending Club Loans Outcomes Prediction


### Background:

The project is to predict whether Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans will become negative (default or late for payment).  The project will help gain insights of default, understand key indicators, and be able to predict default with given indicators. 

### Project design
### Tools
- Programming: Python and common data science libraries, including pandas, numpy, etc.
- Data Prepration: Scikit-learn
- Modeling: Scikit-learn Algorithms
- Visualisation: Matplotlib, Scikit-learn ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix

### Data
The data used for study is from Kaggle covering all loans in Lending Club from year 2007 to 2015. It does not contain latest informatioin.
