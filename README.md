2. Modeling.ipynb: Machine Learning Analysis and visualization
3. Lending Club_final.pptx: Presentation and summarized finding

### Background:

The project is to predict whether Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loan outcome will become negative (default or late for payment).  The project will help gain insights of default, understand key indicators, and be able to predict outcomes with given indicators. 

### Scope
### Project design

Iterate through multiple models

### Tools
- Programming: Python and common data science libraries, including pandas, numpy, etc.
- Data Prepration: Scikit-learn
- Modeling: Scikit-learn Algorithms
- Visualisation: Matplotlib, Scikit-learn ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix

### Data
The data used for study is from Kaggle covering all loans in Lending Club from year 2007 to 2015. The data handling including seerval aspects: 

### Algorithm(s)
Random Forest was identified as best algorithm to predict the outcomes. 

### Result
