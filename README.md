# Lending Club Loans Outcomes Prediction


### Background:

The project is to predict whether Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans will turn negative (default or late for payment). The data used to study is from Kaggle covering all loans in Lending Club from year 2007 to 2015. The project will help gain insights of default, understand key indicators, and be able to predict default with given indicators.
